<h2 id="sec-what">🤔 What is this?</h2>

**Laid Off Yet?** — a Markdown **Agent Skill** for working people.

This is not a hotline that hands you tissues, and not a “be grateful to the company” success seminar.

It’s built to close the dozens of anxious tabs layoffs open in your head—**“Is HR bluffing?” “Should I sign a non-compete?” “How do I fix my résumé by tomorrow?” “What about the mortgage?”**—and replace them with **actions you can take** and **lines you can actually send**.

Works with Codex, OpenClaw, Claude Code, and similar agents.

<h2 id="sec-why">🥺 Why this exists</h2>

Layoffs feel like a 5× drama binge: the process is fast, the information is shattered, and the emotional bill feels priced per second.

You’ve heard enough “You got this!” What you need is substance: **“Don’t sign that today. Say it like this. Before bed, do these three things.”**

This Skill doesn’t promise N+1 or an instant job. It aims to help you **make fewer irreversible mistakes** you’d want to time-travel back and slap yourself for.

<h2 id="sec-can">⚡️ What it can do</h2>

- **Routing**: layoff day, HR talks, non-compete, emotional crash, career change, side income—each has its own branch; it won’t mix “I was laid off today” with “should I join a small company?”
- **Structure**: default **8-part** output—stabilize, assess, then **today/this week** tasks plus **7/30/90-day** timelines.
- **Scripts**: copy-paste lines for HR, your manager, family, and interviewers—e.g. **“Could you put that in writing? I want to make sure I understand.”**
- **Checklists**: day one, week one, 30 days, 90 days—what to do when.
- **Career direction**: structured profiles and rules under `data/` for “what else can I do?”—without pretending to choose for you.

**Core flow (same as `workflows.md`):** stabilize → assess the situation → route the problem → information & strategy → action list → risk notes → timeline → close the loop.

**Boundaries (same as `boundaries.md`):** no definitive legal advice or lawyer replacement; no psychological or medical diagnosis; no retaliation, deleting data, leaks, taking company assets or trade secrets, or sabotage; no coaching to forge or hide evidence. See `.agents/skills/裁了吗/boundaries.md`.

<h2 id="sec-who">🎯 Who it’s for</h2>

- You who just got the “graduation notice” and went blank.
- You negotiating with HR and unsure what to sign.
- You in a gap month and spiraling.
- You pivoting or side-hustling with no idea where to start.

If you want **“what do I do next”** instead of an all-night chat buddy, we’re aligned.

<h2 id="sec-how">🚀 How to use</h2>

1. Clone this repo.
2. Copy `.agents/skills/裁了吗/` into your Agent Skills folder. For career-direction mode, keep the repo-root `data/*.json` files too.
3. Load `SKILL.md` in your agent and follow `decision-tree.md` and `workflows.md`, then start the conversation.

**Example prompt:**

```text
Load the skill: 裁了吗.
I was just laid off; HR wants me to sign a mutual termination today.
Follow the skill structure: stabilize, situation assessment, today/this week actions, copy-ready lines, risk notes, 7/30/90-day timeline.
```
